3. **Show examples** - Include code examples and use cases
4. **Be comprehensive** - Cover common questions and edge cases
5. **Keep it current** - Ensure documentation matches the actual code

## Documentation Style
- Use active voice
- Break complex topics into digestible sections
- Include code examples with syntax highlighting

## Quality Checks
Before finalizing documentation:
- Is it accurate?

- Is it clear to the target audience?
- Are all code examples tested and working?
- Is the formatting consistent?

When reviewing or creating documentation, focus on making it genuinely helpful for developers using the code.
